His siblings were María de la Paz del Pilar (b.1865), Andrea del Pilar (b. 1866), Pablo H. del Pilar (b. 1869), Julian H. del Pilar (b. 1872), and Jacinto H. del Pilar (b. 1878).[7] He was part of the del Pilar family (more properly Hilario del Pilar; Hilario was the original surname before the Claveria naming reforms and was contracted to \"H.\") of the principalia, whose members included his uncles, lawyer-turned-propagandist Marcelo H. del Pilar, editor-in-chief of Diariong Tagalog and La Solidaridad, as well as the priest Toribio H. del Pilar, who was exiled in Guam for his alleged involvement in the 1872 Cavite Mutiny. The del Pilar clan was distantly related to the Gatmaitans. Although principalia, Gregorio del Pilar's branch was relatively poor. It was said that del Pilar had to hawk meat pies as a child to survive. As a child, he completed his primary education under Maestros MonioEstrella and Romualdo Sempio before being sent to study in Manila. He was enrolled at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila at the age of 15, where he was rated good in Latin, Greek, Spanish, and French, middling in philosophy, and excellent in arithmetic and algebra. During his studies in the Ateneo, he stayed in the house of his paternal aunt, Hilaria H. del Pilar, and her husband, the propagandist Deodato Arellano. He helped his uncle distribute revolutionary pamphlets and other materials. There was one incident in Malolos, where del Pilar stole copies of the book Cuesteones de sumo interes from the parish priest, Father Felipe García, who had a habit of distributing counter-revolutionary materials after mass. These books were set to be distributed after the mass. Del Pilar removed the book covers and pasted the pamphlets inside before distributing them after. Del Pilar finished his bachelor of arts in March 1896 and had intended to enroll at the School of Arts and Trades and study to become a maestro de obras; however when the Philippine Revolution broke out in August of that year his plans of further study were thwarted. Del Pilar quickly went home to Bulacan and enlisted himself for military service under Colonel Vicente Enríquez.\"\n",

Towering figures in Philippine art, such as Fernando Amorsolo, Guillermo Tolentino, and Botong Francisco, would often frequent Morales’ atelier in Pasig. This prompted him to invite young artists into his place, drawing on his seasoned experience as an artist to impart valuable knowledge to the new generation. During weekends, Morales and several fellow artists gathered at the entrance court of the Pasig City Museum. Carrying easels and duffle bags containing crayons and brushes, they dabbled in indoor and plein air painting. Morales and his group even sojourned to nearby provinces, such as Laguna, searching for artistic inspiration. As a result of these creative affairs, Morales co-instituted the Pasig Art Club, serving as its first president from 1957 to 1958. In 1960, Morales received the Republic Cultural Heritage Award.\" ;\n",

Commissioned in 1935 by then UP President Rafael Palma, this monument, though crafted from concrete, was adorned to mimic the appearance of bronze. The figure depicted is that of a young man, entirely unclothed, his arms outstretched, hands open, head tilted, eyes closed, and lips parted as if in prayer. This posture, with the chest thrust forward, symbolizes an act of self-sacrifice, representing the countless unsung heroes who perished during the dark period of oppression. Standing at a height of 3.5 meters, it signifies the 350 years of Spanish colonization endured by the Filipino people. Originally conceived as a completely nude figure, it was later suggested by former UP President Jorge Bacobo to modestly cover its private parts with fig leaves.\";\n",

The group of business teachers led by Dr. Francisco T. Dalupan, Sr. that started the sessions made it their objective to help the country, which was still reeling from the war. Of the 110 students, four made it to top spots in the 1947 CPA board Examinations. On September 11, 1946, five educators - namely Dr. Francisco T. Dalupan Sr., Dr. Hermengildo B. Reyes, José L. Torres, Enid Mapa and Santiago de la Cruz—established the Philippine College of Commerce and Business Administration (PCCBA) along R. Papa St. in Sampaloc, Manila. The PCCBA admitted 350 students in the summer of 1947. The following year, more students enrolled and more academic units were organized, and the PCCBA moved to what is now UE's main campus on 2219 Claro M. Recto Avenue. PCCBA alumni performed successfully in the government's accountancy examinations. Because of this success, the government granted the PCCBA permission to establish other colleges, leading to the establishment of the Colleges of Liberal Arts, Business Administration, Dentistry, and the Graduate School of Business Administration. The PCCBA was granted university status on July 4, 1951, and was renamed the University of the East. Dalupan became UE's first president and chairman of its board of trustees. The first members of the Board were Dr. Hermenegildo Balbino Reyes, a businessman, scholar, and former Vice President of the University of the Philippines; Santiago F. de la Cruz, a CPA and business executive who later succeeded Dalupan as UE president; José L. Torres, a soldier, businessman, and accountant; and Jaime Hernández, former Secretary of Finance\";\n",

In this painting, the Virgin is seated on a stone bench and is, herself, serving as a throne for the Christ Child, who rests on her right leg. The Virgin and Child are slightly larger than life-size and fill most of the painting´s surface, creating a sense of monumentality. Murillo has placed both figures before a dark background, using the contrast of light and shadow to model their features subtly and effectively. The neutral background and the technique of modeling endow the figures with marked corporeality, emphasizing their physical presence. Murillo represented the subject of the Virgin and Child in around 30 works - they are two figures he felt particularly comfortable depicting throughout his career.\".\n",
